# kBot

This is a small little fun project I am working on

# What is it about

This is a Discord Bot written in Python, this is mostly a fork of a bunch of bots such as 

* [ziBot](https://github.com/ZiRO-Bot/ziBot) made by [null2264](https://github.com/null2264)
* [Steve The Bot](https://github.com/MCBE-Speedrunning/Steve-Bot) made by the group of [MCBE Speedrunning Staff](https://github.com/MCBE-Speedrunning)

This is mostly a bot made for fun and to be able to spam as many commands as you want
